Use horizontal rules to indicate scene changes:

Meanwhile, in the villain's lair...
```

### Emphasis Combinations

```markdown
He whispered, "_Please_, **you must believe me**!"

The notification appeared: **[Quest Complete!]** _Rewards: 5000 EXP, Rare Item
Box_
```

### Dialogue Formatting

```markdown
"What do you mean?" Sarah asked.

"I mean," John replied, his voice barely above a whisper, "that **everything**
has changed."

She stared at him in disbelief. _This can't be happening_, she thought.
```

2. **Use headings sparingly** - Only for major scene or time changes
3. **Be consistent** - Pick a style for dialogue and stick with it
4. **Use emphasis wisely** - Don't overuse bold or italic text
5. **Preview often** - Check how your chapter looks before publishing
